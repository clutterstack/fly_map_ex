# FlyMapEx

The FlyMapEx library provides a function component to display markers on a simple SVG world map, with or without a legend. It's meant to be simple to use, with a few configuration options. 

Use latitude and longitude, Fly.io region codes, or custom-configured named locations to position nodes on the map. 

You can also customise map colours, marker styles, node and group names, and layout.

FlyMapEx is not a comprehensive mapping library.
